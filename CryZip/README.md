INSTRUCTIONS HOW TO GET YUOR FILES BACK
READ CAREFULLY. IF YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND, READ AGAIN.

This is automated report generated by auto archiving software.

Your computer catched our software while browsing illigal porn 
pages, all your documents, text files, databases was archived 
with long enought password.

You can not guess the password for your archived files - password 
lenght is more then 10 symbols that makes all password recovery 
programs fail to bruteforce it (guess password by trying all 
possible combinations). 

Do not try to search for a program what encrypted your information - it 
is simply do not exists in your hard disk anymore.
If you really care about documents and information in encrypted files 
you can pay using electonic currency $300.
Reporting to police about a case will not help you, they do not know 
password. Reporting somewhere about our e-gold account will not help 
you to restore files. This is your only way to get yours files back.

------------------------------

How to pay to get your information back.

1. click on this link to open your free e-gold account - the first 
   screen is the e-gold "terms and conditions" page. You need to 
   agree to these by clicking on the "I AGREE" button on the bottom 
   on the page.
2. On the next page is the sign up form:
    1. "Account name" - here is where you name your account - tip: 
        make it easy to remember (as you will be asked for it) and 
	  reasonably short, example, "John's e-gold", "My Money e-gold" 
        or perhaps "Felix" (whatever you like, just make it easy for 
        you to remember it).
    2. "User Name" - here just repeat the account name (from 1 above).
    3. "Point of Contact" - this is where you put our name, address, 
        phone number and email address (any email address can be used 
        here but it is recommended you use your ISP address - not a 
        free hotmail, etc address).
        It is also recommended your also include a fax number 
        (don't have a fax number? This company offers free fax to email 
        services). Try and make it as easy as possible for e-gold to contact you.
    4. "Passphrase" - this is the most important piece of information 
        connected to any e-gold account. We can not stress enough how 
        important it is that your passphrase is kept safe and secure.
    5. "Turing Number Entry" - type the 6 numbers you see there into the input 
        box below.
    6.  The last step click "Open"

On the next page it will tell you that your e-gold account number has been emailed to you.

check your email - you can expect to wait up to 5 minutes for your account number 
to arrive. If it does not arrive after 5 minutes then that means the email address 
you supplied was incorrect and you will have to open another new account (go through 
and repeat what you just did above again).
